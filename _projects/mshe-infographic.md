The MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy program infographic highlighting graduate outcomes. This infographic was designed to be interactive and embedded on the website [here](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/higher-education/master-of-science-in-higher-education-administration-policy-degree/career-placement.html). The graphic displays career outcomes of the graduates of the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program and was designed by me to align with branding guidelines and fully embed on the public facing website for the program. The graphic was designed from scratch and all information was displayed to be easily digestable and visually catching.
