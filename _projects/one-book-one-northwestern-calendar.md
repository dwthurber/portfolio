The One Book, One Northwestern program needed a calendar of events for their year-long program. This calendar was designed using the full adobe creative suite in consultation with various stakeholders for event information and design critiques. I designed the graphics and layout of the calendar completely from scratch to match high-resolution commercial printing standards. 

Graphical elements were custom designed using vector graphics for scalability in printing. Custom fonts and patterns were used to give the overall design a cohesive and distinctive theme, which matched the theme for One Book, One Northwestern in each year. The 2015-16 calendar was based on Native American rights and issues from the book The Inconvenient Indian by Thomas King. The 2016-17 calendar was based on The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver.
