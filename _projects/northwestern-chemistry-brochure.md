I was contracted to redesign the program brochure for the Northwestern University Chemistry department. The empahsis on this brochure redesign project was to make the brochure more clean and modern looking and to highlight the significant accolades of the chemistry programs at Northwestern. I created a design which used white space with accent branding purple color to highlight important facts. Images were included to increase the brochure design asthetic and overall visual flow. 

This brochure was designed for a wide audience and would be widely used. I followed Northwestern Branding guides to draft the look and feel of the brochure using adobe InDesign for layout and adobe Illustrator for custom graphics.
