As part of the design team for the Northwestern Feinberg's Career 911 Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) through <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a>. I provided learning design expertise and advice to the content team in the construction of lessons and assessment plans. I also custom designed components of the online course on Coursera's learning management content delivery system, and built an interactive PDF of the course assignments. The interactive PDF provided engaging lessons and scaffolded learning design which walked students through the job search and application process comprehensively from start to finish. The "Career Journey" both in PDF and online format were created with the desire for gamification and use of motivation principles in mind. We created "Quests" instead of assignments and the modular structure of the online class was meant to be completed self-paced and in the desired order of the student much like completing a wandering journey for a video game character.

All content was custom designed for learning in a massive open online course with the unique challenges of scale and access. A great deal of thought was put into how to design the course for a diverse audience spanning across the world and across the spectrum of age and experience to create the most engaging course possible no matter the learner's prior knowledge and desired outcomes. Through this process, I learned a lot about the challenges of engaging and motivating learners in an online setting and how to create assessments that were both comprehensive but also not demotivating to complete. I also taught myself how to create a PDF form and word templates (for resume and cover letter template) which greatly improved the ability of the content team to provide interactive learning in the online setting.
